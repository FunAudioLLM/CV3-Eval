happy_high_uttid_19 I saw a little dog playing with its owner on the street today. The way it wagged its tail made my heart melt.
happy_high_uttid_20 I ran into a teacher I hadn’t seen in years at the coffee shop today. He still remembered me, and we talked about so many fun memories.

happy_high_uttid_24 I bought a folding chair today, sat on the balcony, and soaked up the sun. The wind blew gently, and it felt like the world was giving me a warm hug.

sad_high_uttid_1 The research institute won’t renew my contract, so I have to go back to my country. I don’t even have a job anymore.
sad_high_uttid_2 After being the one to make the effort for so long, everyone gets tired. It’s not that the love is gone, it’s just that the heart is exhausted.
sad_high_uttid_3 If I had been more determined back then, the three of us wouldn’t have ended up like this.
sad_high_uttid_4 Friends… Is this what friends really need?
sad_high_uttid_5 Grina is the last woman I’ve ever played along with. Trust me, please.
sad_high_uttid_6 From the very beginning, our relationship was a noble friendship. We had an agreement. She was the one who betrayed me, went back on her word. Let me tell you, I’m the victim here.
sad_high_uttid_7 So, the Emperor knew everything all along. I’m such a fool.
sad_high_uttid_8 The little one rushed over and hugged her, bursting into tears immediately.
sad_high_uttid_9 I really don’t know how to face all of this. I feel like I’ve been drained of everything.
sad_high_uttid_10 Why did this happen? I really tried my best. Why did I still lose everything?
sad_high_uttid_11 I feel like I’m lost in the darkness and can’t find a way out anymore.
sad_high_uttid_12 This pain feels like it’s suffocating me, as if my heart is going to split apart.
sad_high_uttid_13 I don’t have the strength to bear it anymore. Why does everything bad always happen to me?
sad_high_uttid_14 I thought I could hold on, but everything changed, and now all hope is gone.
sad_high_uttid_15 I really don’t understand. Why did everything become so complicated? Why can’t we go back to the way things were?
sad_high_uttid_16 Everything has changed. The promises and dreams we once had are shattered. How should I face this?
sad_high_uttid_17 I never imagined that a day like this would come. Now, I just want it all to end.
sad_high_uttid_18 Reviewing is so painful. I learn something, forget it, learn it again, and forget it again.
sad_high_uttid_19 Math is so hard. No matter how hard I try to think, it feels like I still can’t solve these problems. What should I do?
sad_high_uttid_20 She actually thought I was the one who did it. How could I have done such a thing? This misunderstanding really hurts me.
sad_high_uttid_21 I’ve known him for eight years, and he still cheated on me. It’s such a wasted effort.
sad_high_uttid_22 I thought this relationship would last, but now it’s over. What should I do now?
sad_high_uttid_23 Every time I close my eyes, all I can think about are the painful memories, and I can’t help but cry.
sad_high_uttid_24 The things are still there, but the people are gone. I want to speak, but tears come first.
sad_high_uttid_25 The ones who once promised to never be apart have already scattered to the ends of the earth.

angry_high_uttid_6 If the explanation you're about to give is about that thing where you deceived me, it’s better if you just don’t explain at all.
angry_high_uttid_7 Aren’t you going to leave soon? Stop interrupting me while I’m trying to study!

angry_high_uttid_9 Stop wasting my time with nonsense and tell me where you’ve taken Katie!
angry_high_uttid_10 That idiot, Ryan, forgets his own name the moment he sees a pretty girl.
angry_high_uttid_11 If you’d ever treated me like a human being, would they have dared to do this?
angry_high_uttid_12 Stop crying, okay? Can we not have this argument every time we fight?
angry_high_uttid_13 I told you, stop nagging, alright? Haven’t you nagged enough in this lifetime?
angry_high_uttid_14 Why can’t you just speak like a normal person?
angry_high_uttid_15 Do you remember the price we paid? Do you remember the dreams and promises we once had?
angry_high_uttid_16 It’s all your fault! You weren't paying attention to the master, insisting on catching some demon. You failed to catch the demon and lost the master, and you still blame me!
angry_high_uttid_17 What exactly do you want from me?
angry_high_uttid_18 Does your job involve just chatting with people? I’ve had enough!
angry_high_uttid_19 Can't you ever think about anyone but yourself? Everything you do, you only care about your own interests!
angry_high_uttid_20 Shut up! It’s always you who makes a mess of things. Can you just be quiet for once?
angry_high_uttid_21 You’re driving me crazy! It’s always the same issue—why can't you ever get it?
angry_high_uttid_22 Every time, I’m the one cleaning up your mess. When are you ever going to learn?
angry_high_uttid_23 I’m done arguing with you. You're not worth my time!
angry_high_uttid_24 You never show any gratitude—always making others worry about you, and in the end, you couldn’t care less!
angry_high_uttid_25 Is that really how you think you're always right? It’s always your way, and no one else’s opinion matters!
