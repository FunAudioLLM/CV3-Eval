uttid_1 Born once every 100 years, dies in flames.
uttid_2 My whole entire bloody life, time and time again.
uttid_3 Kids are talking by the door.
uttid_4 I mean, I've been looking for a job for like three years. And I can't get a job. I mean, like, it's America, right, I should be able to get a job.
uttid_5 i am so so so so sorry
uttid_6 Local business in the area. And I can't, I can't get anything, nobody.
uttid_7 From August 18 of their divorce.
uttid_8 The surface is slick.
uttid_9 Say, oh dear. I'm bored with this conversation.
uttid_10 Hold up my chin. Slow and solid.
uttid_11 I went to see her headstone a week or two, though.
uttid_12 Chapter 10, a warm welcome.
uttid_13 Today isn't any other day.
uttid_14 We've got friends. It's why we moved here because there's a daycare down the street.
uttid_15 But one requires the explorer to furnish proofs.
uttid_16 I just, I know, I don't see how they can make you leave me out. You have a new behavior, wherever you can.
uttid_17 You had a rough day. Oh, yeah. No idea. Come on.
uttid_18 Please invite Tom if there is not requires.
uttid_19 I'd shoot myself, the pause.
uttid_20 Are you a regular darky, really.
uttid_21 If you hadn't been so nosy, you never would have known a thing about it.
uttid_22 That is exactly what happened.
uttid_23 Annie, please, please don't hurt me.
uttid_24 I just saw my best friend's brain smeared across the canvas. It's not going to be me, not me.
uttid_25 You're very helpful. What's your name.
uttid_26 Did you get the mail, Did she saw my letter.
uttid_27 I'd far rather go without them, than eat them.
uttid_28 I think I have a doctor's appointment.
uttid_29 They're not going to let you have to stay home, and I have to go home.
uttid_30 Dogs are sitting by the door.
uttid_31 Rat came and replied, on the leaves.
uttid_32 We all see Panda on TV, or in the zoo.
uttid_33 True.
uttid_34 Well, I thought a lot about what you said. And I realized, maybe I was a little judgmental.
uttid_35 So Tom saw night as it were broad daylight.
uttid_36 Why is it just like the round egg, which sounds thin.
uttid_37 but it's been so long like what what am i what am i waiting i can probably do something else or
uttid_38 Okay, but how do I, that's not proof to me, How do I know that that it's really you, I need.
uttid_39 An hour out of Guildford town.
uttid_40 Yes, the business, the business doesn't inspire me.
uttid_41 Don't forget a jacket.
uttid_42 All this. Have we won by our labor.
uttid_43 Maybe tomorrow, it will be cold.
uttid_44 The newborn baby is stolen, as we go.
uttid_45 It says no way, shouted Daisy.
uttid_46 Fresh pains seized Paul's body.
uttid_47 You also could remember that I got sand in my panties. We got an argument over nothing. You got a sore throat, and we didn't even get to see the grenions.
uttid_48 Yes, we listen. You're going to go on like 1000 interviews before you get a job.
uttid_49 I'm so sorry.
uttid_50 That's my point. So let's go. No, no, that's not my point. My point is, what's the point if you come down here if we just turn around and leave.
